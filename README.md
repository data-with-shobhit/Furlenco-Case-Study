# Furlenco Case Study

## Overview
This case study explores Furlenco’s business model through guesstimates, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and synthetic data research. The goal is to understand customer behavior, optimize pricing strategies, and evaluate key performance metrics using data-driven methodologies.

## Objectives
- Develop guesstimates to assess market size and customer demand.
- Conduct A/B testing to analyze the impact of different pricing and subscription models.
- Perform hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about customer retention and churn.
- Demonstrate findings using synthetic data simulations and statistical techniques.

## Approach
1. **Guesstimates & Market Analysis**: Estimated market demand and customer acquisition potential.
2. **A/B Testing**: Designed experiments to compare subscription plans and pricing strategies.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Used statistical tests to validate key business assumptions.
4. **Synthetic Data Demonstration**: Created realistic datasets to simulate customer behavior and business scenarios.
5. **Insights & Recommendations**: Identified actionable strategies for improving revenue and customer experience.

## Key Findings
- A/B testing revealed that flexible rental options increase customer engagement.
- Hypothesis testing showed a significant correlation between price sensitivity and customer churn.
- Guesstimates suggested high growth potential in untapped metro cities.
- Synthetic data modeling effectively simulated real-world customer behavior for testing strategies.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL for data querying
- Excel for initial analysis
- Power BI/Tableau for visualization

## Conclusion
This case study leverages a data-driven approach to evaluate Furlenco’s market potential and operational efficiency. Insights from guesstimates, A/B testing, and hypothesis testing help shape strategic business decisions for customer acquisition and retention.
